# Dependencies

I'm just going to fill these in as I use them explicitly to maintain sanity. Also,
probably won't put descriptions for well known packages here.

* gulp-autoprefixer - automatically adds browser prefixes to css
* gulp-stylus - Stylus css processor for gulp, because we need more.
* history - session history manager

# TODO: Improvement/Refactor threads

* [autobind-decorator](https://github.com/andreypopp/autobind-decorator) - decorator to make binding class methods easier.
